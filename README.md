# Practicing React Design Patterns

This repo is further experimentation & practice of advanced React design patterns, inspired by the [React: Design Patterns](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-design-patterns/take-your-react-skills-to-the-next-level?autoplay=true&resume=false) course on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/).

## To Install
1. Clone this repo to your local machine
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `nvm use 16` to change Node versions (you'll get errors if you try to run on Node 18)
4. Run `node server.js` to use the `server.js` file as the database (many of the component branches use server.js)
5. Run `npm run start`
6. Visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view site
7. To change branches, run `git checkout <branch-name>`

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the 6 main concepts in the course. Feel free to look around!

* `cmp--layouts`
* `cmp--containers`
* `cmp--controlled-vs-uncontrolled`
* `cmp--higher-order-components`
* `cmp--custom-hooks`
* `cmp--functional-design-patterns`

You'll also find additional README's in each branch, with extra explanations and my takeaways on the components.
