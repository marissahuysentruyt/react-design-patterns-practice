          In this repo, you'll have to navigate between branches.

          I didn't have a great grasp of React before I got my first developer role. Thankfully, I had some unassigned time when I started, so I decided I would try to bolster my React understanding. This course was really helpful for me in understanding how to break down components, how to get them to interact in more predictable ways, how data flows between components, and overall helped me see an application in a different light.

          This repo is not <span className="cta__span">everything</span> on design patterns or React. But after going through Shaun's course, I felt like I had learned a lot, and felt myself looking at projects a little differently! As a self-taught dev, I want to share what helped me make the connections for others trying to do the same thing.
